#Python: A History

Python is a modular, high level, general purpose, dynamically typed, interpreted programming language that focuses on readability and writability using natural language. It supports both object oriented and procedural programming. Python was originally designed by Dutch programmer, Guido van Rossum, improving upon the language ABC which he had worked on earlier in his career.

Rossum wanted to create a more human readable scripting language that was faster and easier to write in than C. As a result, Python replaces block symbols with indentation, and uses words as operators frequently, including and, or, is, and not. Thanks to its modularity, it is also highly extensible. Data types are dynamically determined at run time and one variable can refer to different types throughout the program. Python is platform independent and interpreted, which makes it faster to develop and test.

In 1991, Python was released as open source, which contributed to its success, with thousands of developers contributing to it over the years, both creating core Python code and their own libraries and frameworks. These have allowed Python to be used for specialized industries. For example, NumPy is used for scientific and mathematical applications, and Django and Flask are frameworks used for web development.
