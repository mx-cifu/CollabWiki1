# Python: A History

Python is a modular, high level, general purpose, dynamically typed, interpreted programming language that focuses on readability and writability using natural language. It supports both object oriented and procedural programming. Python was originally designed by Dutch programmer, Guido van Rossum, improving upon the language ABC which he had worked on earlier in his career.

Rossum wanted to create a more human readable scripting language that was faster and easier to write in than C. As a result, Python replaces block symbols with indentation, and uses words as operators frequently, including and, or, is, and not. Thanks to its modularity, it is also highly extensible. Data types are dynamically determined at run time and one variable can refer to different types throughout the program. Python is platform independent and interpreted, which makes it faster to develop and test.

In 1991, Python was released as open source, which contributed to its success, with thousands of developers contributing to it over the years, both creating core Python code and their own libraries and frameworks. These have allowed Python to be used for specialized industries. For example, NumPy is used for scientific and mathematical applications, and Django and Flask are frameworks used for web development.

While Python has numerous reasons as to why it is still a highly prevalent and popular languages, some of the most touted reasons include its relative simplicity, large community of developers (and libraries), and flexibility. Python syntax is simple for beginners and professionals alike, most basic Python code can be read and understood fairly easily which makes starting off with coding, or starting to work on a pre-existing code base easier than it might be in other languages. As a result of its popularity, Python has one of the largest user bases who continue to create modules and packages which are pre-existing code that expand the capabilities of Python, which further allows Python to reach into different areas of coding such as AI or Data Analysis through a library like NumPy. Lastly, Python is extremely flexible and works well with other programming languages and even as a language with distributed computing. 

Python is however not without its drawbacks, especially when considering the downsides that come with an interpreted language, and that Python is a dynamically typed language. Since Python is an interpreted language, that basically means instead of the code being converted into machine code before it is executed, each line is executed one at a time by the interpreter which can lead to decreases in performance speeds, especially with larger data sets and coding programs. It also shares this problem with memory performance, as Python’s garbage collector struggles a bit more when up against larger data sets because of the nature of its implementation. Similarly, while Python grants increased flexibility with its dynamic typing, meaning variables are not type-checked at compilation, it also means that there is a possibility of unexpected errors and mistakes that arise from not being able to recognize the data type of a variable at first glance. 

Python and Java are both two extremely popular high-level programming languages. Both languages share object-oriented paradigms, a large user/community base, and are typically available in most OS as both are platform independent (for the most part). They do however have a few differences as Python is a dynamically typed language that doesn’t require a variable’s type to be declared while Java does. Additionally, Python is an interpretative language while Java is a compiled language that turns compiles all code into a machine language before it is executed. Lastly, Python’s syntax is widely praised for its legibility, using indentations to mark blocks and often has less lines of code which is directly opposed to Java that has additional required components for its syntax like brackets and semicolons.
